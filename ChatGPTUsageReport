First prompt: We have a dataset of energy production in a wind turbine park. The data is temporal: the measurements are taken every 6 hours. However, we have a high amount of "nans", that we do not want to remove, so we don't lose information. Maybe replacing them for the mean is not the best option, as the result in energy consumption depends a lot on the time the measurement was taken. Which other options do we have? Could it be possible to take the value of the same hour but a different day, or it will distort our data?

Answer: Handling missing data in a temporal dataset like yours requires careful consideration to avoid introducing bias or distorting the patterns in the data. Here are some alternative strategies you can consider:
Forward Fill (or Backward Fill): Replace missing values with the most recent (or next) available observation. This is a reasonable approach for time-series data where consecutive values are expected to be similar.
Interpolation: Use interpolation methods to estimate missing values based on the surrounding values. Linear interpolation is a simple method, but more complex methods like spline interpolation may capture non-linear patterns better.
Mean Imputation within a Window: Instead of using the overall mean, calculate the mean within a specific time window (e.g., same hour of different days) and use that value for imputation. This retains some temporal context.
Seasonal Decomposition: Decompose your time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Impute missing values separately in each component and then reconstruct the time series. This helps in preserving seasonality patterns.
Multiple Imputation: Use statistical techniques like multiple imputation to create multiple datasets with different imputed values. Analyze each dataset separately and then combine the results to account for uncertainty introduced by imputation.
Regarding your question about using values from the same hour on a different day, it can be a reasonable approach, especially if there is a strong temporal pattern in your data. However, keep in mind that the appropriateness of this method depends on the nature of your data and the context of the problem. Before deciding, you may want to explore the data visually and check whether such imputations align with the underlying patterns.
It's crucial to perform sensitivity analysis and evaluate the impact of different imputation methods on your downstream analyses. Additionally, documenting the imputation strategy is essential for transparency in your data processing pipeline.
